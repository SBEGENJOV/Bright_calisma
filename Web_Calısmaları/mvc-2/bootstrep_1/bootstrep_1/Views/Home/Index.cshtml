                    Hey to you reading this (: whatever brings you here, wether it's to fall asleep or to relax from something stressful, i just wanted to let you know that everything will be fine. If you're going through a hard time right now, it's okay to remind yourself that this is temporary, and there are many good and relaxing days to come. If you're about to sleep, i hope you will have the most beautiful dreams, and the most peaceful sleep.<hr />
